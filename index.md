This site contains reports generated using [`nix-review-tools`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-review-tools) for evaluations of major [Hydra](https://hydra.nixos.org) jobsets, which list the packages that failed to build by platform and problematic dependencies (packages whose failure to build caused other packages to fail to build due to being a dependency of the latter package). Reports are added/updated hourly.

See the [About](about/) page for more info, and [malob/nix-review-tools-reports](https://github.com/malob/nix-review-tools-reports) on GitHub for the code for this project.
